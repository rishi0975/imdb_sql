<h1><strong>Problem Introduction</strong></h1>

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience, but for their next project, they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies released in the past three years. You have to analyze the dataset and draw meaningful insights to help them start their new project.

As a data analyst and SQL expert, you must use SQL to analyze the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.
